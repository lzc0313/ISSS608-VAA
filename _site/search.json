The overlap between Science and Reading suggests similar performance levels in these subjects, with a less pronounced rightward extension than Mathematics, implying fewer high scorers. The shape and spread of the distributions indicate variability in student performance across all subjects, with Mathematics displaying a potential for both higher peaks and greater spread, hinting at a wider variance in achievement. These visual cues complement the earlier analysis, underscoring Mathematics as a strong suit in the Singapore education system while highlighting the need for continued focus on literacy to address the lower performance and greater variability observed in Reading."

Firstly, it’s evident that students from certain schools consistently maintain similar scores across all three subjects. However, in other schools, there is a noticeable trend where science and mathematics scores are higher, while reading scores appear to be comparatively lower.\nFurthermore, it’s interesting to note that schools achieving high scores in mathematics also tend to perform well in science, suggesting a potential correlation between these two subjects. Additionally, there are instances, albeit rare, where certain schools excel in reading, outperforming their scores in the other two subjects. These observations indicate the presence of distinct patterns and potentially valuable insights into the performance of students across different schools and subjects."

This suggests a notable performance advantage for males in mathematics within this sample.\nReading: Females outperform males by a substantial margin, with their average score being approximately 20 points higher. This considerable difference highlights a stronger performance in reading for females.\nScience: Males again have a higher average score, with the difference being approximately 6 points. While this advantage is less pronounced than in mathematics, it still indicates better performance by males in science.\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of scores, are different across genders for each subject. Males tend to have larger IQR across all subject compare to female, a larger IQR indicates more variability in student performance.The presence of outliers, as indicated by points beyond the whiskers of the boxplots, suggesting that there are students with scores that are unusually low or high compared to their peers.\nFurther analysis might be needed: Adding confidence intervals around the mean could provide insight into the statistical significance of the differences in means between genders."
