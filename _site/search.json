The shape and spread of the distributions indicate variability in student performance across all subjects, with Mathematics displaying a potential for both higher peaks and greater spread, hinting at a wider variance in achievement. These visual cues complement the earlier analysis, underscoring Mathematics as a strong suit in the Singapore education system while highlighting the need for continued focus on literacy to address the lower performance and greater variability observed in Reading."

Firstly, it’s evident that students from certain schools consistently maintain similar scores across all three subjects. However, in other schools, there is a noticeable trend where science and mathematics scores are higher, while reading scores appear to be comparatively lower.\nFurthermore, it’s interesting to note that schools achieving high scores in mathematics also tend to perform well in science, suggesting a potential correlation between these two subjects. Additionally, there are instances, albeit rare, where certain schools excel in reading, outperforming their scores in the other two subjects. These observations indicate the presence of distinct patterns and potentially valuable insights into the performance of students across different schools and subjects."

This considerable difference highlights a stronger performance in reading for females.\nScience: Males again have a higher average score, with the difference being approximately 6 points. While this advantage is less pronounced than in mathematics, it still indicates better performance by males in science.\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of scores, are different across genders for each subject. Males tend to have larger IQR across all subject compare to female, a larger IQR indicates more variability in student performance.The presence of outliers, as indicated by points beyond the whiskers of the boxplots, suggesting that there are students with scores that are unusually low or high compared to their peers.\nFurther analysis might be needed: Adding confidence intervals around the mean could provide insight into the statistical significance of the differences in means between genders."

Furthermore, it is notable that the interquartile range (IQR) increases progressively as we move from lower ESCS bins to higher ones, indicating a widening spread of scores. This widening IQR suggests a greater degree of variability in scores among students as the ESCS index increases, reflecting the diversity in academic performance among students with different socio-economic backgrounds."

Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nbelow codes combines two histogram.\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“/” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about this topics, refer to Plot Assembly.\n2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nTo identify the subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities shown below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating figure with insert\nOther than putting the graphs side by side, we can put graph on top or below one another using inset_element() of patchwork.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating composite figure using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"

    "text": "3.1 Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n3.1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n3.1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\nTip\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n3.3.1 Building a static population bubble plot\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Building the animated bubble plot\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\nThe animated bubble chart\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')"

The overlap between Science and Reading suggests similar performance levels in these subjects, with a less pronounced rightward extension than Mathematics, implying fewer high scorers. The shape and spread of the distributions indicate variability in student performance across all subjects, with Mathematics displaying a potential for both higher peaks and greater spread, hinting at a wider variance in achievement. These visual cues complement the earlier analysis, underscoring Mathematics as a strong suit in the Singapore education system while highlighting the need for continued focus on literacy to address the lower performance and greater variability observed in Reading."

Firstly, it’s evident that students from certain schools consistently maintain similar scores across all three subjects. However, in other schools, there is a noticeable trend where science and mathematics scores are higher, while reading scores appear to be comparatively lower.\nFurthermore, it’s interesting to note that schools achieving high scores in mathematics also tend to perform well in science, suggesting a potential correlation between these two subjects. Additionally, there are instances, albeit rare, where certain schools excel in reading, outperforming their scores in the other two subjects. These observations indicate the presence of distinct patterns and potentially valuable insights into the performance of students across different schools and subjects."

This considerable difference highlights a stronger performance in reading for females.\nScience: Males again have a higher average score, with the difference being approximately 6 points. While this advantage is less pronounced than in mathematics, it still indicates better performance by males in science.\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of scores, are different across genders for each subject. Males tend to have larger IQR across all subject compare to female, a larger IQR indicates more variability in student performance.The presence of outliers, as indicated by points beyond the whiskers of the boxplots, suggesting that there are students with scores that are unusually low or high compared to their peers.\nFurther analysis might be needed: Adding confidence intervals around the mean could provide insight into the statistical significance of the differences in means between genders."

This observation holds true despite the presence of some outliers within each bin, which can affect the overall sample distribution. Furthermore, it is notable that the interquartile range (IQR) increases progressively as we move from lower ESCS bins to higher ones, indicating a widening spread of scores. This widening IQR suggests a greater degree of variability in scores among students as the ESCS index increases, reflecting the diversity in academic performance among students with different socio-economic backgrounds."

The shape and spread of the distributions indicate variability in student performance across all subjects, with Mathematics displaying a potential for both higher peaks and greater spread, hinting at a wider variance in achievement. These visual cues complement the earlier analysis, underscoring Mathematics as a strong suit in the Singapore education system while highlighting the need for continued focus on literacy to address the lower performance and greater variability observed in Reading."

Firstly, it’s evident that students from certain schools consistently maintain similar scores across all three subjects. However, in other schools, there is a noticeable trend where science and mathematics scores are higher, while reading scores appear to be comparatively lower.\nFurthermore, it’s interesting to note that schools achieving high scores in mathematics also tend to perform well in science, suggesting a potential correlation between these two subjects. Additionally, there are instances, albeit rare, where certain schools excel in reading, outperforming their scores in the other two subjects. These observations indicate the presence of distinct patterns and potentially valuable insights into the performance of students across different schools and subjects."

This considerable difference highlights a stronger performance in reading for females.\nScience: Males again have a higher average score, with the difference being approximately 6 points. While this advantage is less pronounced than in mathematics, it still indicates better performance by males in science.\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of scores, are different across genders for each subject.

This observation holds true despite the presence of some outliers within each bin, which can affect the overall sample distribution. Furthermore, it is notable that the interquartile range (IQR) increases progressively as we move from lower ESCS bins to higher ones, indicating a widening spread of scores. This widening IQR suggests a greater degree of variability in scores among students as the ESCS index increases, reflecting the diversity in academic performance among students with different socio-economic backgrounds."

Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can see from the plot?\n\n\n\n\n3A,3B,3D tend to follow a normal distribution\nlower bond of 3A is slightly lower compare to students in 3B, but at the higher bond 3A students perform much better compare to 3B students.\n3B students tend to be perform similarly well.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().

    "section": "1.4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot",
    "text": "1.4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n1.4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\n2.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.
